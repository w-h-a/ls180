Here's my step-by-step walk through for assignment 8.

PART I
1. After making a database for assignment 7, I imported the required file.
2. I checked the relation list. We seem to have an implicit _me_ entity singleton class, an explicit _contact_ entity class, and a _calls_ relationship class. Let's get to it!
3. I needed to create a conceptual schema before continuing.
  - The entity classes are:
    - _me_
      - `create table me(id int generated by default as identity primary key);`
      - `insert into me (id) values (1);`
    - _contact_ (`alter table contacts rename to contact;`)
  - The relationship classes are:
    - _calls_
      - `alter table calls add column me_id int references me(id);`
      - `update calls set me_id = 1;`
      - `alter table calls alter column me_id set not null;`
      - `alter table calls alter column me_id set default 1;`
  - Now each item class has a relation schema (and more).
  - The cardinality constraints are:
    - `card(calls, me) = MANY`
    - `card(calls, contact) = ONE` (so _calls_ is a many-to-one relationship).
  - Now I have a complete conceptual schema of this relational database, and I have reorganized the relational database to better fit this conceptual schema.
4. Now we can return the following virtual relation:
  - `select calls.id, calls.when, calls.duration, contact.first_name, contact.last_name, contact.number from contact join calls on calls.contact_id = contact.id;`
5. Let's add one more element for our calls relation, in accordance with Launch instructions:
  - To solve I wrote: `insert into calls ("when", duration, contact_id) values ('2016-01-18 14:47:00', 632, 6);`
  - Compare Launch's: `INSERT INTO calls ("when", duration, contact_id) VALUES ('2016-01-18 14:47:00', 632, 6);`

PART II
From Launch: "Write a SQL statement to retrieve the call times, duration, and first name for all calls not made to William Swift."

To return a relation between when, duration, and first name for calls not made by William Swift, we may submit:
  - To solve I wrote: `select "when", duration, contact.first_name from contact join calls on calls.contact_id = contact.id where contact.id != 6;`
  - Compare Launch's: `SELECT calls.when, calls.duration, contacts.first_name FROM calls INNER JOIN contacts ON calls.contact_id = contacts.id WHERE (contacts.first_name || ' ' || contacts.last_name) != 'William Swift';`

PART III
Let's insert more data to update our relations.
  - To Solve I wrote:
    1. `insert into contact (first_name, last_name, number) values ('Merv', 'Elk', 6343511126), ('Sawa', 'Fyodorov', 6125594874);`
    2. `insert into calls ("when", duration, contact_id) values ('2016-01-17 11:52:00', 175, 26), ('2016-01-18 21:22:00', 79, 27);`
  - Compare Launch's:
    1. `INSERT INTO contacts (first_name, last_name, number) VALUES ('Merve', 'Elk', '6343511126');`
    2. `INSERT INTO contacts (first_name, last_name, number) VALUES ('Sawa', 'Fyodorov', '6125594874');`
    3. `INSERT INTO calls ("when", duration, contact_id) VALUES ('2016-01-17 11:52:00', 175, 26);`
    4. `INSERT INTO calls ("when", duration, contact_id) VALUES ('2016-01-18 21:22:00', 79, 27);`

PART IV
From Launch: "Add a constraint to contacts that prevents a duplicate value being added in the column number."
  - To Solve I wrote: `alter table contact add constraint number_unique unique (number);`
  - Compare Launch's: `ALTER TABLE contacts ADD CONSTRAINT number_unique UNIQUE (number);`
